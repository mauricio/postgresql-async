 *
 * Pool specialized in database connections that also simplifies connection handling by
 * implementing the [[com.github.mauricio.async.db.Connection]] trait and saving clients from having to implement
 * the "give back" part of pool management. This lets you do your job without having to worry
 * about managing and giving back connection objects to the pool.
 *
 * The downside of this is that you should not start transactions or any kind of long running process
 * in this object as the object will be sent back to the pool right after executing a query. If you
 * need to start transactions you will have to take an object from the pool, do it and then give it
 * back manually.
